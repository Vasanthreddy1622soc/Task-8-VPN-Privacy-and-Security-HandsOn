# VPN Privacy & Security Hands-On Project 🔐🌍

This project is part of a cybersecurity practical assignment focused on understanding how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect online privacy and secure communication. The task includes installing ProtonVPN, verifying IP masking, observing encrypted browsing, and comparing performance with and without VPN enabled.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- ProtonVPN Free Tier
- Google Chrome Browser
- whatismyipaddress.com for IP verification

---

## 📝 Task Overview

### Objectives
- Learn the purpose and security features of VPNs
- Demonstrate IP masking and encrypted network traffic
- Analyze browsing performance with VPN enabled vs disabled

### Steps Performed
1. Selected ProtonVPN as a reputable free VPN provider
2. Created account, downloaded, and installed VPN client
3. Connected to the fastest free server (Singapore)
4. Verified IP change and encrypted browsing using HTTPS checks
5. Disconnected VPN to compare behavior and network speed
6. Documented observations and screenshots as proof of execution

## 📌 Key Observations

| Condition | IP Address | Location | Speed | Privacy Level |
|----------|------------|----------|-------|----------------|
| VPN OFF | 152.57.229.174 | India | Normal | Exposed |
| VPN ON | 103.216.221.77 | Singapore | Slight delay | Protected & masked |

- Encryption Protocol: **WireGuard (UDP)**
- Traffic was highly secured with **AES-256** encryption
- Websites correctly detected VPN as a privacy tool
- Minor speed drop due to encrypted routing

## 🛡 VPN Benefits
- Protects identity by masking real IP address
- Prevents ISP tracking and malicious interception
- Secures data on public Wi-Fi networks
- Helps bypass regional restrictions

## ⚠ Limitations
- Slightly slower browsing speed
- Limited features on free VPN plans
- Restricted number of server locations

---

## 📷 Proof of Work
Screenshots included in `/screenshots`:
- VPN Connected (Singapore Server)
- IP Verification with VPN ON
- IP Verification with VPN OFF

---

## 📚 Outcome
Successfully gained practical skills in:
- VPN configuration and secure browsing
- Privacy testing methodologies
- Evaluation of security tool strengths and weaknesses

---

## 🔖 Conclusion
This project clearly demonstrates that VPNs are essential tools for safeguarding online privacy. By encrypting data and masking user identity, ProtonVPN significantly enhanced security while browsing. VPNs are especially valuable for anyone using public or insecure networks.
